  Some of the following questions will ask you to use
  arrow function syntax. On the problems that don't,
  feel free to practice with any syntax.
*/


////////////////// PROBLEM 1 ////////////////////
/*
  Create a function called helloWorld which simply console logs 'Hello, World!'
  Call the function.
*/

//CODE HERE

function helloWorld(){
  console.log(hellow)
}
////////////////// PROBLEM 2 ////////////////////

let namesArr = ['Cameron', 'Riley', 'Eric', 'Brenna', 'Karl']
/*
  Create a function called printAllNames that takes in a single argument (an array of names).
  Using a for loop, iterate over that array and console log each name.
  Call the function, passing in the `namesArr` array (above).
*/

//CODE HERE


////////////////// PROBLEM 13 ////////////////////
/*
  Create a function called thatsOdd that takes in a single argument (a number).
  Using conditional logic, if the number is even, return 'That's not odd!'
  Otherwise, return 'That is odd indeed!'
  Outside the function, create a variable called `oddChecker` and set it equal to your function invoked, making sure to pass in an argument.
*/

//CODE HERE


////////////////// PROBLEM 14 ////////////////////

/*
    Write a one line arrow function called 'bestMovie' that takes in one parameter,
    which will be a string of a movie title. 
    The function should return the string: 'MOVEIEPARAM is the best movie ever!'. 
    For example, if we passed in 'Sharknado', 
    we would expect the function to return 'Sharknado is the best movie ever!'

////////////////// PROBLEM 15 ////////////////////
let bigOrSmallArray = [1,101, 102, 2, 103, 4, 5, 6, 107]
/* 
  Create a function called 'bigOrSmall' that takes in one parameter, 'arr',  which will be an array of numbers. 
  Inside of the bigOrSmall function, create a new array called 'answers'. 
  Then, loop over the passed in arr parameter, and check to see if the number in the array is GREATER than 100. 
  If it is, push 'big' as a string to the answers array. 
  If the number is LESS than or EQUAL to 100, push 'small' as a string to the answers array. 
  Return the answers array inside of the function to a variable called `arrayEvaluator`.

////////////////// PROBLEM 16 ////////////////////
let contestants = ['Katniss', 'Peeta', 'Fox-face', 'Glimmer', 'Cato', 'Rue', 'Thresh', 'Clove', 'Marvel']
let loser = 'Glimmer'
/*
  Write a function that is called theEliminator, which takes in two arguments, contestants (which will each be an array of strings), and loser (which will be a string).
  The function should loop over the array of contestant names. If the loser string appears in the array, splice it out. Return the new contestants array.

////////////////// PROBLEM 17 ////////////////////
let sampleString = "Hi, my name is Kylo."
/*
  Write a function that takes in one argument, a string. The function should then console.log that string, in entirely uppercase characters.
  Invoke the function, passing in the sampleString (above).
*/

//CODE HERE


////////////////// PROBLEM 18 ////////////////////
/*
  Write a function called emailCheck that takes in
  one parameter - email.
  Inside the function, convert the email param into 
  a string and trim off any excess whitespace.
  Check to make sure the email contains an '@' symbol.
  If it does, return 'email verified' and if doesn't, 
  return 'must provide a valid email address'
*/

////////////////// PROBLEM 19 ////////////////////
/*
  Write a function, naming it whatever you believe to be appropriate, that buys as many chocolate frogs as possible with a certain amount of gold. Each chocolate frog costs 3 gold. Your function should take in a single parameter, which is the amount of gold you are willing to spend. Your function should return a total amount of chocolate frogs you were able to purchase.
  Create a variable called `totalFrogs` and set it equal to your function invoked, passing in the amount of gold you are willing to spend.
*/

//CODE HERE


////////////////// PROBLEM 20 ////////////////////
/*
  You might have noticed a slight bug in the previous problem. If you were to pass in 4 gold, the function would return to you 1.3333... However, you can't really go to a store and by 1.333 products. You would just be able to purchase 1 product. Re-write the function you used in the previous problem (give it the same name, just add a 2 to the end of it) that fixes this bug. Invoke the function and store the returned value to a variable called `totalFrogs2`.

////////////////// PROBLEM 21 ////////////////////
let sampleArray = [0,1,2,3,4,7,5,6,8,9]
/*
  Write a function that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. In the body of the function, write logic to determine if the array is in ascending order. The function should return true, if it is sorted in ascending order, false if it is not. Create a variable, `arrayIsAscending` and set it equal to your function invoked. Use the sample array to test this function.
